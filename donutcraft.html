  <h1>Getting Started</h1>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h2>Main Idea</h2>
    <p>I do not want to hold players hand through out the pack; I want players to be able</p>
    <p>to build what they want and all that, but I have many recipe changes to make things</p> 
    <p>a little more challegneing. One of them being how machines are made. So bascially you</p>
    <p>are going to need to get started in IC2, Forestry and TechReborn, from there you can go to Thermal Expansion.</p>
    <p>Now this may take some time, but once you got somewhat far in each mod and have enough</p>
    <p>resources you can start working on an AE2 system. Then you will be able to go in and</p>
    <p>start automating everything with AE2.</p>
   <h2>Spawning in</h2>
    <p>Just like any other pack you are going to want to go around and find materials.</p>
    <p>I haven't really altered much with early game stuff and not sure if I am going to </p>
    <p>because as of right now it seems to be balaning out with the challenges later.</p>
  <h2>First Machines</h2>
    <p>You need to start by making the Iron Alloy Furnace, from there you make bronze so you</p> 
    <p>can get the carpenter and you will also want to make a clock work engine to power the</p> 
    <p>carpenter. After that you can start making circuits so you can start making machines like</p> 
    <p>the electric alloy smelter, macerator, batbox, etc.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> </p>
  <h3>The reset is up to you, play around and test things to keep progessing throughout the pack and mods.</h3>
